## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Import to R the following file:

```{r}
winequality <- read.csv(file =               "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

Check data characteristics. Is there missing data? 

```{r}
str(winequality)
summary(winequality)
sum(is.na(winequality) == TRUE)
```
There are 4898 observation and 12 variables.

There is no missing data

Visualize quality

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$quality)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

fixed.acidity

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$fixed.acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

volatile.acidity

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$volatile.acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

citric.acid

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$citric.acid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

residual.sugar

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$residual.sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```
chlorides

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

free.sulfur.dioxide
```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$free.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```
total.sulfur.dioxide

```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$total.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

density
```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$density)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

pH
```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$pH)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```
sulphates
```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```

alcohol
```{r}
ggplot(data = winequality,aes(x = winequality$alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "yellow", col = "green")
```
Reduce the levels of rating for quality to three levels as high, medium and low

```{r}
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(3,4,5))] = "low"
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(6))] = "medium"
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(7,8,9))] = "high"
winequality$quality <- as.factor(winequality$quality)
```
fixed.acidity Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = fixed.acidity, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and fixed.acidity") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

volatile.acidity Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = volatile.acidity, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and volatile.acidity") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```
This plot helps us note that high quality wines have less amount of volatile acidity.
citric.acid Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = citric.acid, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and citric.acid") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```
Again, per our observation we note that higher quality wines have higher levels of citric acid
residual.sugar Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = residual.sugar, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and residual.sugar") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

chlorides Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = chlorides, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and chlorides") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

free.sulfur.dioxide Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and free.sulfur.dioxide") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

total.sulfur.dioxide Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and total.sulfur.dioxide") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

density Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = density, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and density") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```
We can see that best quality wines have lowest density 
pH Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = pH, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and pH") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```

sulphates Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = sulphates, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and sulphates") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```


alcohol Vs quality

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = alcohol, fill = quality)) +
geom_density(alpha=0.5, aes(fill=factor(quality))) + labs(title="quality and alcohol") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + theme_grey()
```
As per our observation, good quality wines have higher levels of alcohol.

Within the same range of density, best quality wines have highest level of alcohol.

```{r}
#install.packages("gridExtra")
library(gridExtra)
f1 <- ggplot(winequality, aes(x = density, y = alcohol, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
f2 <- ggplot(winequality, aes(x = density, y = residual.sugar, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
f3 <- ggplot(winequality, aes(x = density, y = total.sulfur.dioxide, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
grid.arrange(f1, f2, f3, ncol=3)
```
Within the same range of density, best quality wines have highest level of alcohol.In the above 3 graphs, holding density (mostly from the lower end of density), higher residual.sugar or alcohol, or total sulfur dioxide seem to have better quality respectively.


```{r}
e1 <- ggplot(winequality, aes(x = alcohol, y = residual.sugar, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
e2 <- ggplot(winequality, aes(x = alcohol, y = chlorides, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
grid.arrange(e1, e2, ncol=2)
```
In the above 2 graphs, holding residual.sugar or chlorides, higher alcohol level seem to have better quality.

```{r}
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide, col = quality, shape = quality)) + geom_point()
```
it seems that there are more better quality wine under 150 total sulfur dioxide.

```{r}
d1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = density, x = alcohol))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
d2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide, x = alcohol))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
d3 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = chlorides, x = alcohol))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
d4 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = residual.sugar, x = alcohol))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(d1, d2, d3, d4, ncol=2, nrow = 2)
```
Alcohol is strongly correlated to density, and weakly correlated to residual sugar, total sulfur dioxide, and chlorides.

```{r}
c1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = residual.sugar, x = density))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
c2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide, x = density))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
c3 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = chlorides, x = density))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
c4 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = free.sulfur.dioxide, x = density))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(c1, c2, c3, c4, ncol=2, nrow = 2)
```
Density is strongly correlated to residual sugar, and weakly correlated to chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, free sulfur dioxide.

```{r}
b1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = density, x = residual.sugar))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
b2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = alcohol, x = residual.sugar))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
b3 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide, x =  residual.sugar))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
b4 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = pH, x = residual.sugar))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(b1, b2, b3, b4, ncol=2, nrow = 2)
```
Residual sugar level is strongly positively correlated to density, weakly negatively correlated to alcohol and positively correlated to total sulfur dioxide. Residual sugar is not correlated to pH.

```{r}
z1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = density, x = total.sulfur.dioxide))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
z2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = alcohol, x = total.sulfur.dioxide))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(z1, z2, ncol=2)
```

Total sulfur dioxide is strongly correlated to alcohol.

```{r}
a1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = density, x = chlorides))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
a2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = alcohol, x = chlorides))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
a3 <-ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide, x = chlorides))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(a1, a2, a3, ncol=3)
```

Chlorides is positively correlated to density although not a strong relationship. Chlorides is slightly correlated to total.sulfur.dioxide.

```{r}

p1 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = density, x = fixed.acidity))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
p2 <- ggplot(data = winequality, aes(y = pH, x = fixed.acidity))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```
Fixed acidity is negatively correlated to pH and positively correlated to density weakly.
