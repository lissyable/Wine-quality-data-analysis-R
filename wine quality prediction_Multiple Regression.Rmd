## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Import to R the following file:

```{r}
winequality <- read.csv(file =               "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

Divide the data to training and testing groups.

```{r}
wine_split <- sample(nrow(winequality), floor(nrow(winequality)*0.7))
train <- winequality[wine_split,]
test <- winequality[-wine_split,]
```

Use the multiple Regression algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes.

```{r}
model_lm <- lm(quality ~ ., data = train)
summary(model_lm)
```

Now we can use backward elimination method

```{r}
library(MASS) 
stepB <- stepAIC(model_lm, direction= "backward", trace=TRUE)
summary(stepB)
```
So we end up with using variables: fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, residual.sugar, 
    free.sulfur.dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol
```{r}
new_model <- lm(quality ~ fixed.acidity + volatile.acidity + residual.sugar + 
    free.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol, data = train)
prediction = predict(new_model, interval="prediction", newdata = test)
prediction
```
