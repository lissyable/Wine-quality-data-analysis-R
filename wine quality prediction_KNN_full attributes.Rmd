This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Import to R the following file:

```{r}
winequality <- read.csv(file =               "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

Check data characteristics. Is there missing data? 

```{r}
str(winequality)
summary(winequality)
sum(is.na(winequality) == TRUE)
```
There is no missing data

The correlation between the attributes other than wine quality?

```{r}
wine <- winequality[,-12]
wine_cor <- cor(wine)
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(wine_cor, method = "number")
```
Taking a look at the correlation coefficients r for the predictor variables, we see that density is strongly correlated with  residual.sugar (r=0.84) and alcohol (r=???0.78), and moderately correlated with total.sulfur.dioxide (r=0.53).  free.sulfur.dioxide and total.sulfur.dioxide are also moderately correlated with each other (r=0.62).

Reduce the levels of rating for quality to three levels as high, medium and low

```{r}
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(3,4,5))] = "low"
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(6))] = "medium"
winequality$quality[which(winequality$quality %in% c(7,8,9))] = "high"
winequality$quality <- as.factor(winequality$quality)
```

Graph the frequency distribution of wine quality.

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(winequality, aes(x = quality, fill = quality)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2), '%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) + 
    labs(x = 'quality', y = 'percent', fill = 'quality', title = 'quality')
```
Normalize the data set.

```{r}
normalize <- function(x) {
  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) }
winedata <- as.data.frame(lapply(wine, normalize))
```


Divide the data to training and testing groups.

```{r}
split_data <- sample(nrow(winedata), floor(nrow(winedata)*0.7))
winedata_train <- winedata[split_data,]
winedata_test <- winedata[-split_data,]

winedata_train_labels <- winequality[split_data, 12]
winedata_test_labels <- winequality[-split_data, 12]
```

Use the KNN algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes.

```{r}
#install.packages("class")
#install.packages("gmodels")
library(class)
library(gmodels)
winedata_test_pred <- knn(train = winedata_train, test = winedata_test, cl = winedata_train_labels, k=10, prob = TRUE)
winedata_test_pred


```

Evaluate the model performance.

```{r}
CrossTable(x=winedata_test_labels, y=winedata_test_pred, prop.chisq=FALSE)

k <- 1:10
for(x in k){
  winedata_test_pred <- knn(winedata_train, winedata_test,
                    winedata_train_labels, k = x)
  accuracy <- mean(winedata_test_pred == winedata_test_labels)
  cat('\n','When k =', x, "accuracy is ", accuracy)
}
```
As we can see, the model has the highest accuracy of 65% when k=1.Then the next highest accuracy is 56% when k=3. When we repeat the process for k from 1 to 50 we see some decrease and then increase.
```{r}
accuracy <- rep(0, 50)
k <- 1:50
for(x in k){
  winedata_test_pred <- knn(winedata_train, winedata_test,
                    winedata_train_labels, k = x)
  accuracy[x] <- mean(winedata_test_pred == winedata_test_labels)
  }
plot(k, accuracy, type = 'b')
```
